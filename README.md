# SerDes Configuration File Generator

This GUI application allows users to easily generate configuration files for SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) devices featuring Maxim (now part of Analogue Device) and related hardware components. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input various parameters and settings, and then generate a configuration file containing a series of I2c commands to configure the SerDes devices and associated hardware.

This code is intertionally written by me for SONY Semiconductor Solutions, the I2C command reaches the NOR-Flash of the automotive image sensors through SSP-500z FPGA. Please note that this code contains nothing confidential, although this code is definatly not competible with anything outside SONY, but this provides a solution and algorithom towardes how to easly set up and configure the stauts of a MAX series SerDes. 

For details of MAX series SerDes, please refer to ADI website.

# Key Features:

Input Information: Users can provide manufacturer information, author details, select a serializer type, choose a deserializer type, and input other parameters such as voltage divider resistor values and FSYNC / RESET PIN numbers.

R1 & R2 is the pull up and pull down resistors respectivly, by a certain combination of R1 & R2, through the voltage devider rule, the transmission rate, slave address and other settings were determined. The programme is capable to determine the mode by simply type in the value of the resistors.  

Circuit Visualization: The application dynamically generates circuit diagrams (shown above) based on the entered resistor values and PIN numbers, displaying the voltage divider ratio.

Configuration File Generation: By clicking the "Compile Now" button, the application generates a configuration file. This file includes a sequence of I2C commands to configure data transmission rates, output formats, sensor addresses, reset triggers, and more for the serializer and deserializer.

File Path Display and Opening: The application shows the path where the generated configuration file is saved and provides a button to open the generated file.

Parameter Selection and Auto-Update: Users can choose different options from dropdown menus, such as serializer and deserializer types. The interface updates automatically to display relevant information based on the selected options.

The purpose of this application is to simplify the process of generating SerDes configuration files. Users can input parameters through an intuitive interface, quickly generating the required configuration files. Please refer to the provided code for implementation details and customization options.

# Usage:

Enter the manufacturer and author information.
Select the desired serializer and deserializer types.
Input resistor values and PIN numbers for configuring the circuit.
Choose the output format and sensor type.
